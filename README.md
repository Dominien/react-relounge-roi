## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

## Webflow Integration

### 1. Host the Bundle File

Yes, Vercel is an excellent choice for hosting your bundle file. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a new project on Vercel (sign up if needed)
2. Connect your GitHub repository or upload the `dist` folder directly
3. Make sure to deploy the entire project (not just the dist folder)
4. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to your project (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`)
5. You'll be able to access:
   - Demo page at the root URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app/`
   - Bundle file at: `https://your-project.vercel.app/roi-calculator-bundle.js`

**Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment**:
- If you can't see the calculator at your Vercel URL, make sure you're deploying the entire project, not just the dist folder
- The repository includes a `vercel.json` configuration file that tells Vercel how to build and serve the project
- When you deploy to Vercel, it will automatically run the build command that copies index.html to the dist folder
- This allows you to see the calculator demo at your Vercel URL as a preview

Other hosting options include:
- Amazon S3
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages

### 2. Add Required Scripts to Webflow

In Webflow:
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on "Project Settings" in the left sidebar
3. Select "Custom Code" tab
4. In the "Head Code" section, paste the following:

```html
<!-- Libraries required for the ROI calculator -->
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.2.0/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.2.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
```

5. Click "Save Changes"

### 3. Add the Component to Your Page

1. In the Webflow Designer, navigate to the page where you want the calculator
2. From the left panel "Add Elements", find and drag an "Embed" element to your page
3. Click on the Embed element to select it
4. In the right panel, click "Embed Code"
5. Paste the following code:

```html
<!-- ROI Calculator Container -->
<div id="roi-calculator" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"></div>

<!-- ROI Calculator Script -->
<script src="https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL/roi-calculator-bundle.js"></script>
```

6. Replace `https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL` with your actual Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`)

The `div` is where the calculator will appear, and the `script` tag loads your React component.

### 4. Publish Your Webflow Site

Publish your Webflow site for the changes to take effect.
